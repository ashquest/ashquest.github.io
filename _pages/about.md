I’m Aashish Sinha, a mechanical engineering undergrad at IIT Dhanbad, India with a clear focus on robotics and the growing world of vision-language-action systems. I work at the intersection of hardware, perception, and modern AI models, and I’m especially interested in VLMs, VLA pipelines, and techniques that push robots beyond predictable, pre-scripted behavior.

I’ve taken on projects that mix real-world manipulation, multimodal sensing, and experimental setups where I can test ideas quickly and iterate fast. I’m comfortable moving between code, hardware, and theory, and I like building systems that actually work outside a controlled demo.

When I’m not in the lab, I’m usually out hiking, tuning hardware, or digging through new research to spark the next idea.

I’m preparing for my next step in fall 2026. I’m exploring either a research-focused master’s or a full-time research role in robotics or embodied AI — anywhere I can contribute at a high level and keep pushing the field forward.
